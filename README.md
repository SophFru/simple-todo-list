# Simple To-do List

A simple to-do list tool I made to practice jquery and event driven programming.

I'm planning on turning this into a chrome extension, but for now this tool can run in any browser that supports jquery.

## Tools
- HTML/CSS
- Javascript/JQuery

## Future features
- edit items after confirmation
- save to-dos for later
- counter to track number of completed items
